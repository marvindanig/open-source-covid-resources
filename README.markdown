# Sophisticated Medical Equipments & Ventilators


[MIT Emergency Ventilator (E-Vent) Project](https://e-vent.mit.edu/)

MIT is one of the several teams who recognized the challenge of the anticipated global lack of ventilators. In the US alone, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause ventilator shortages on the order of 300,000-700,000 units. This project aims to solve that.

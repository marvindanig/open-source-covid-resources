## Sophisticated Medical Equipment & Ventilators

1. [Open Source Ventilator](https://github.com/CSSALTlab/Open_Source_Ventilator)

Project spearheaded by CSSALTlab. License information is missing but the headline says open source ventilator. 


2. [MIT Emergency Ventilator (E-Vent) Project](https://e-vent.mit.edu/)

MIT is one of the several teams who recognized the challenge of the anticipated global lack of ventilators. In the US alone, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause ventilator shortages on the order of 300,000-700,000 units. This project aims to solve that.

3. [Engineers Assemble](https://engineersassemble.tribe.so)

Covid-19 Makers is a community of Makers and engineers in the UK organized to design and build medical equipment and ventilators to save lives and our healthcare system in the fight against Covid-19

4. [Trevor Blackwell's exploratory ventilator using computer fans](https://twitter.com/tlbtlbtlb/status/1242615050990280704).

The project isn't out in the open yet. Hopefully, it will be soon and we'll update the link on the repo here then.
